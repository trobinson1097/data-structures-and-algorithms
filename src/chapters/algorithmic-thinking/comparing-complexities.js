## O(1) - Constant Time

Constant time algorithms perform the same number of operations regardless of input size.

- **Characteristics**: Execution time remains constant regardless of input size
- **Examples**: Array access by index, hash table insertion/lookup (average case)
- **When it's good**: Ideal for operations that need to be extremely fast
- **Real-world analogy**: Finding a book on your desk when you know exactly where it is

## O(log n) - Logarithmic Time

Logarithmic time algorithms reduce the problem size by a factor (usually 2) with each step.

- **Characteristics**: Execution time grows very slowly as input size increases
- **Examples**: Binary search, balanced binary tree operations
- **When it's good**: Excellent for large datasets where linear search would be too slow
- **Real-world analogy**: Finding a word in a dictionary using divide-and-conquer approach

## O(n) - Linear Time

Linear time algorithms process each input element exactly once.

- **Characteristics**: Execution time grows linearly with input size
- **Examples**: Array traversal, linear search
- **When it's good**: Efficient for processing all elements once
- **Real-world analogy**: Reading every page in a book from start to finish

## O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time

Linearithmic algorithms combine linear and logarithmic behaviors.

- **Characteristics**: More efficient than quadratic but slower than linear
- **Examples**: Efficient sorting algorithms (merge sort, quicksort, heapsort)
- **When it's good**: Often the best possible time complexity for sorting-related problems
- **Real-world analogy**: Sorting a deck of cards using an efficient strategy

## O(n²) - Quadratic Time

Quadratic time algorithms process each element in relation to every other element.

- **Characteristics**: Execution time grows with the square of the input size
- **Examples**: Nested loops, bubble sort, insertion sort
- **When it's good**: Acceptable for small inputs, but problematic for large datasets
- **Real-world analogy**: Checking every possible pair in a group of people

## Complexity Comparison Chart

| Complexity | 10 elements | 100 elements | 1000 elements |
|------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| O(1)       | 1           | 1            | 1             |
| O(log n)   | ~3          | ~7           | ~10           |
| O(n)       | 10          | 100          | 1,000         |
| O(n log n) | ~30         | ~700         | ~10,000       |
| O(n²)      | 100         | 10,000       | 1,000,000     |

## Practical Considerations

When analyzing algorithm complexity:

- Constants matter in practice, even if they're dropped in Big-O notation
- Lower complexity doesn't always mean faster for small inputs
- Consider both average and worst-case scenarios
- Space complexity is increasingly important in memory-constrained environments
- The specific use case should guide algorithm selection
