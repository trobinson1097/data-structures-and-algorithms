  Hi 👋,
You'll be guiding your partner through the coding problem on the right side of your screen. 

⚠️ **Please do not share this URL / problem before class.**  
Revealing the question early defeats the purpose of simulating a real-world interview, where candidates do not know the problem in advance. Let's give your partner the chance to experience the challenge authentically.

🧠 **Before class:**  
Take time to study the problem. During the session, you'll have 90 minutes in your breakout room to run a mock interview with your partner. Be sure to take turns acting as the interviewer and interviewee.

🗣️ **As the interviewer, your responsibilities are:**
- Send this URL to your partner (copy and past the whole url and slack it directly to you partner)
- Briefly introduce the problem
- Never give away the answer
- Take notes and provide feedback
- Fill out this [feedback form](https://forms.gle/sXK3tJaGNEk52jm4A)

🗣️ **As the interviewee, your responsibilities are:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Follow the steps in the [solving guide](https://forms.gle/sXK3tJaGNEk52jm4A):
    Step 1: Clarify
    Step 2: Plan
    Step 3: Implement
    Step 4: Test
    Step 5: Optimize

🪞 **After the first interview:**  
Leave 10–15 minutes to reflect, share feedback, and then switch roles.

Best of luck, and enjoy the practice! 🚀

## Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

### Follow-up Questions:
- What is the time complexity of your solution?
- What is the space complexity?
- What if you could make multiple transactions?`,

Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Examples:
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5 (buy at price 1, sell at price 6)

Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0 (no profit possible)

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 4 (buy at price 1, sell at price 5)

Follow-up Questions:
- What is the time complexity of your solution?
- What is the space complexity?
- What if you could make multiple transactions?
