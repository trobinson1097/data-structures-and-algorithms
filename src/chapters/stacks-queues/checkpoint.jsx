      questionJsx: <p>What is a key trade-off when implementing a queue using an array versus a linked list?</p>,
      answers: [
        "Array-based queues use more memory",
        "Linked list queues are always slower",
        "Array-based queues may require O(n) dequeue operations",

        "Stack: C, B, A | Queue: A, B, C",
