## Using .sort() with Comparators

JavaScript provides a built-in \`Array.prototype.sort()\` method that makes sorting arrays convenient. This chapter explores how to use this method effectively, particularly with custom comparator functions.

## From Simple Strings to Complex Records

The next day, Alex returned to Groove Records to find Sam looking frustrated again. "The alphabetical sorting worked great for that small collection," Sam said, "but I realized my real inventory is much more complex. Each record isn't just a title - it has an artist, release year, price, condition, and more information."

Sam showed Alex his inventory system:

```javascript
// Each record is now an object with multiple properties
const vinylCollection = [
  {
    title: "Abbey Road",
    artist: "The Beatles",
    releaseYear: 1969,
    price: 24.99,
    condition: "mint"
  },
  {
    title: "Dark Side of the Moon",
    artist: "Pink Floyd",
    releaseYear: 1973,
    price: 29.99,
    condition: "very good"
  },
  {
    title: "Thriller",
    artist: "Michael Jackson",
    releaseYear: 1982,
    price: 19.99,
    condition: "good"
  }
  //...
];

vinylCollection.sort();
console.log(vinylCollection);
// Still in the same order! JavaScript doesn't know how to compare objects
```

"When I try to sort this collection, JavaScript doesn't know what to do," Sam explained, demonstrating the problem:

Maya nodded knowingly. "This is where comparator functions become essential. You need to tell JavaScript exactly how to compare your records."

## Basic Usage of sort()

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array:

```javascript
const numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6];
numbers.sort();
console.log(numbers); // [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]

const fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape'];
fruits.sort();
console.log(fruits); // ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'orange']
```

## The Default Sorting Problem

"Let me show you why the default sort doesn't work with your records," Alex said, pulling up Sam's inventory on the computer.

```javascript
// When JavaScript tries to sort objects, it converts them to strings first
const record1 = { title: "Abbey Road", artist: "The Beatles" };
const record2 = { title: "Thriller", artist: "Michael Jackson" };

console.log(String(record1)); // "[object Object]"
console.log(String(record2)); // "[object Object]"

// Both convert to the same string, so JavaScript can't tell them apart!
```

"That's exactly the problem I'm having!" Sam exclaimed. 

"And even with simple data, the default string sorting can surprise you," Maya added, showing them an example with Sam's price list:

```javascript
const prices = [1.99, 15.99, 100.99, 20.99, 3.99];
prices.sort();
console.log(prices); // [1.99, 100.99, 15.99, 20.99, 3.99]
// Sorted as strings: "1" comes before "2", so "100.99" comes before "20.99"!
```

Sam shook his head. "No wonder my sorting was all wrong. I need a way to tell JavaScript how to properly compare my records."

## Comparator Functions: Telling JavaScript How to Sort

"The solution is comparator functions," Maya explained. "You write a function that takes two records and tells JavaScript which one should come first. The function takes two arguments (let's call them a and b) and returns:
- A negative value if a should come before b
- A positive value if a should come after b
- Zero if a and b are equal in terms of sorting order

Sam was intrigued. "Show me how this works with my vinyl collection."

Alex demonstrated with Sam's records:

```javascript
// Sort by album title
vinylCollection.sort((recordA, recordB) => {
  if (recordA.title < recordB.title) return -1;  // A comes before B
  if (recordA.title > recordB.title) return 1;   // A comes after B
  return 0;                                      // A and B are equal
});

console.log("Sorted by title:");
vinylCollection.forEach(record =>
  console.log(`${record.title} - ${record.artist}`)
);
// Abbey Road - The Beatles
// Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd
// Thriller - Michael Jackson
```

Sam's eyes lit up. "So the comparator function is like giving JavaScript a set of rules for comparing my records!"

## Sorting by Different Record Properties

"Oh, wow!" Sam said excitedly. "I can sort by any property of my records!"

Maya smiled. "And notice how each comparator function follows the same pattern - it takes two items and returns a positive, negative or zero value that tells JavaScript how to put them in the correct order."

See Exercise 1 and complete each of those three functions to sort by different properties

## Advanced Sorting: Multiple Criteria

A week later, Sam came to Alex with a new challenge. "Customers often want to sort by multiple criteria. For example, they want all Beatles albums sorted by release year, then all Pink Floyd albums sorted by release year, and so on."

"That's called multi-level sorting," Alex explained. "You sort by the primary criteria first, then by secondary criteria when the primary criteria are equal."

```javascript
// Sort by artist, then by release year within each artist
function sortByArtistThenYear(collection) {
  return collection.sort((a, b) => {
    // First, compare by artist
    const artistComparison = a.artist.localeCompare(b.artist);
    if (artistComparison !== 0) {
      return artistComparison; // Artists are different, use artist order
    }
    
    // Artists are the same, so compare by release year
    return a.releaseYear - b.releaseYear;
  });
}

// Sort by price range, then by condition within each price range
function sortByPriceThenCondition(collection) {
  const conditionOrder = { "mint": 1, "very good": 2, "good": 3, "fair": 4 };
  
  return collection.sort((a, b) => {
    // First, compare by price
    const priceComparison = a.price - b.price;
    if (priceComparison !== 0) {
      return priceComparison;
    }
    
    // Prices are the same, so compare by condition
    return conditionOrder[a.condition] - conditionOrder[b.condition];
  });
}
```

Sam tested this with his Beatles collection:

```javascript
const beatlesAlbums = [
  { title: "Let It Be", artist: "The Beatles", releaseYear: 1970, price: 22.99 },
  { title: "Abbey Road", artist: "The Beatles", releaseYear: 1969, price: 24.99 },
  { title: "Sgt. Pepper's", artist: "The Beatles", releaseYear: 1967, price: 29.99 }
];

sortByArtistThenYear(beatlesAlbums);
// Result: Sgt. Pepper's (1967), Abbey Road (1969), Let It Be (1970)
```

"Perfect!" Sam said. "Now I can create sophisticated browsing experiences for the hardcore fans!"


### Handling Missing Data

```javascript
// Some records might not have complete information
const incompleteRecords = [
  { title: "Unknown Album", artist: "Mystery Artist", releaseYear: null },
  { title: "Abbey Road", artist: "The Beatles", releaseYear: 1969 }
];

// Safe sorting that handles missing years
function sortByYearSafely(collection) {
  return collection.sort((a, b) => {
    // Put records with missing years at the end
    if (a.releaseYear === null) return 1;
    if (b.releaseYear === null) return -1;
    return a.releaseYear - b.releaseYear;
  });
}
```

"I guess sorting isn't just about algorithms," Alex reflected. "It's about understanding your data and your business requirements."

Sam agreed. "Every sorting decision I make affects how customers experience my store. The right comparator function can make the difference between a frustrated customer and a happy sale!"

Try out a couple more examples in Exercise 2.

## Stable vs. Unstable Sorting

A stable sort preserves the relative order of equal elements. JavaScript's sort() is required to be stable as of ES2019:

```javascript
const items = [
  { id: 1, value: 'B' },
  { id: 2, value: 'A' },
  { id: 3, value: 'B' },
  { id: 4, value: 'A' }
];

// Sort by value
items.sort((a, b) => a.value.localeCompare(b.value));

console.log(items);
// [
//   { id: 2, value: 'A' },
//   { id: 4, value: 'A' },
//   { id: 1, value: 'B' },
//   { id: 3, value: 'B' }
// ]
```

Note that id:2 always comes before id:4, and id:1 always comes before id:3. If this sort method didn't reliably maintain the original relative ordering between items that compare as equal, it would be considered **unstable**

## Performance Considerations

The time complexity of \`sort()\` depends on the browser implementation:
- Most modern browsers use Timsort or similar algorithms with O(n log n) complexity
- The space complexity is typically O(log n) to O(n)

For very large arrays or performance-critical applications, consider:
- Using a specialized sorting library
- Implementing a specific algorithm optimized for your data
- Pre-sorting data when possible to avoid repeated sorts
