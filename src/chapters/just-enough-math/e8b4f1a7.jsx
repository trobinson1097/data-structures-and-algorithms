    questionJsx: <p>Suppose a company has a website tracker to see how much traffic comes to their website. Due to a bug in the software, traffic is added that is not real. The company knows that they have an average 10 visits per day, but the website tracker observes 100 visits the second day, 1,000 visits the third day, 10,000 visits the fourth day, and so on. What statement accurately describes the growth rate of the buggy tracker?</p>,
    answers: [
      "The traffic grows logarithmically.",
      "The traffic grows exponentially at first, then logarithmically.",
      "The traffic grows exponentially.",
      "The traffic grows logarithmically at first, then exponentially."
