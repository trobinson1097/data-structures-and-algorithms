This course is here to help you circle back and solidify your foundations, whether you're preparing for interviews or leveling up your software skills. Each week, you'll get hands-on practice solving problems, sharpening your analytical thinking, and exploring how different data structures work and when to use them. You'll also learn how to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms and tackle some classic ones that will hone your logic and creativity—all in a realistic, interview-style setting.

Think of this course as stepping back into the kitchen not just to cook, but to sharpen your knives and restock your toolkit. While your original bootcamp focused on building real-world projects, this course takes a step back to focus on the smaller building blocks—the foundational pieces that power those projects. Instead of complete full applications, we’ll dissect how smaller pieces work under the hood. You'll strengthen your understanding of core data structures and algorithms, and you will write cleaner, faster, and more efficient code. 

The goal is to return to project work with deeper insight, sharper skills, and the confidence to tackle hard problems.

## 👥 Who This Course Is For
This course is designed for bootcamp grads preparing for technical interviews, and for anyone looking to build steady, meaningful progress toward mastery and confidence in solving problems with code.

We assume you’re comfortable with at least one programming language. While we’ll use JavaScript to demonstrate concepts, the skills and strategies you’ll learn apply across languages—Python, Java, C#, and beyond.

We’ll strip things down to the essentials—no frameworks, no extras—just the core problem-solving skills that work across any language, tech stack, or domain. Whether you’re heading into embedded systems, web development, cloud infrastructure, or data engineering, this foundation travels with you. It’s powerful precisely because it doesn’t assume where your path leads—it prepares you for all of it.

As an adult learner, you stay engaged when content feels relevant. That’s why every topic in this course connects directly to real-world coding and interview situations. Research shows that relevance, hands-on learning, and self-direction are key to lasting understanding. You’ll learn by doing, reviewing, and reflecting—because experience-based learning sticks.

And if something ever feels unclear or disconnected, speak up. We’re here to help you see the value, not just the challenge. This is your journey. Let’s make it purposeful, practical, and—yes—even enjoyable. 😊

## 🧪 A Quick Example of what you will learn
Imagine two surveys—one with 10,000 responses, the other with 12,000. You need to check whether any participants responded to both. There are multiple ways to solve this, but some scale better than others.
By the end of this course, you’ll have the tools to analyze both, see the performance trade-offs, and confidently choose the better approach using Big‑O thinking. 

\`\`\`javascript
function hasCommonRespondent(surveyAResponses, surveyBResponses) {
  for (let i = 0; i < surveyAResponses.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < surveyBResponses.length; j++) {
      if (surveyAResponses[i] === surveyBResponses[j]) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
function hasCommonRespondent(surveyAResponses, surveyBResponses) {
  const respondedToA = new Set();

  for (const respondent of surveyAResponses) {
    respondedToA.add(respondent);
  }

  for (const respondent of surveyBResponses) {
    if (respondedToA.has(respondent)) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}
\`\`\`

## 🧠 How Do You Choose?
Do you go with the version that’s shorter? The one that’s easier to read? What about one that uses less memory, or the one that should run faster? How much faster is “faster”? And on whose machine are we measuring on?

These are the kinds of questions engineers face all the time, and the answers aren’t always clear at first. That’s why, throughout the course, we’ll guide you in learning how to think about performance using Big‑O. It’s a way to describe how code scales, no matter what machine you’re on or how fast it runs. It helps cut through the guesswork so you can make thoughtful decisions before you even hit "run."

By the end, you won’t just be picking solutions that feel right, you’ll be able to explain why one is better with confidence.

## ⏰ Time Commitment & Course Duration

**Expected Weekly Commitment:** ~10 hours per week
**Expected Weekly async Commitment:** ~6 hours per week async self study / prep
**Expected Weekly in class  Commitment:** ~4 hours per week two time 2 hours on zoom

**Course Duration:** 10 weeks
**Total Course Hours:** ~100 hours

## Attendance 
Practice pairing sessions will take place during the second class of each week, giving us time in the first session to solidify concepts you’ve reviewed asynchronously through group activities and discussion.
After the second class session each week, we’ll send out the pairings for the following week. 

We’ll exclude students from the pairings if we know ahead of time they’ll be absent. 
To help us plan accurately, please let us know at least one week in advance if you’ll be out, so we can adjust the pairings accordingly and ensure your partner isn’t left without someone to work with.

## 🗓️ Course Structure
- Live Zoom Sessions: 2 sessions per week, each 2 hours long 
(the zoom link is pinned at the top of your cohorts slack channel)

- Slack Channel: Is used for discussions, announcements
- Slack Channel: Join the conversation, ask questions, and stay updated.
Look for: #dsa-{your cohort number} — for example, Cohort One = #dsa-01

### Class Session Format (Repeats weekly):
#### Day 1
  Hour 0.5: Instructor-led walkthroughs, quizzes, discussions, demonstrations, reviews
  Hour 1.5: Pair coding programming practice

#### Day 2

###  How to reach us
Got a question? The \`#help\` channel on Slack is the perfect place to ask!

### 🧪 What to Expect from Pair Programming Practice
Each week, you’ll team up with a classmate to practice a mock coding interview. You’ll take turns being the interviewer and the interviewee, working through a problem together in a breakout room. Don’t worry—this isn’t about getting everything right. It’s a safe space to mess up, try things, struggle a bit, and learn by doing. The key is to show up, stay engaged, and lean into the challenge. Even if you don’t solve the problem, just working through it will help you get more comfortable, build confidence, and make the eventual solution stick. This time is meant to help you grow, so use it well!
- The goal is to practice thinking out loud and solving problems under pressure
- Build confidence giving and receiving feedback
- Get comfortable with the interview format
You’ll receive all prep details ahead of time, including the problem (for the interviewer only). During the session, you’ll follow a simple process, switch roles halfway, and reflect together at the end.
