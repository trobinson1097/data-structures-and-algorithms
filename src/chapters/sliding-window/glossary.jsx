  // Core Sliding Window Concepts
  { term: "Sliding Window", definition: "A computational technique that maintains a 'window' (contiguous subarray) that slides through financial time-series data to efficiently calculate indicators like moving averages and volatility measures.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Fixed-Size Window", definition: "A sliding window where the size remains constant, perfect for financial indicators like 20-day moving averages or 30-day volatility calculations.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Variable-Size Window", definition: "A sliding window that can grow or shrink based on conditions, ideal for finding optimal trading periods or performance thresholds in financial analysis.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Window State", definition: "The aggregated information maintained about the current window, such as sum, count, or frequency maps used in portfolio analysis and risk calculations.", week: "7"},
  
  // Financial Applications
  { term: "Moving Average", definition: "A financial indicator calculated using fixed-size sliding windows to smooth price data over a specific period, commonly used in technical analysis.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Rolling Volatility", definition: "A risk measure calculated using sliding windows to determine price variability over consecutive time periods, essential for portfolio risk management.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Time-Series Analysis", definition: "The analysis of financial data points collected over time, where sliding window techniques enable efficient calculation of indicators and patterns.", week: "7"},
  
  // Technical Concepts
  { term: "Two Pointers", definition: "A technique using left and right pointers to define variable-size window boundaries, commonly used in optimization problems for finding optimal trading periods.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Frequency Counter", definition: "A data structure (Map or object) that tracks occurrences of elements within the current window, useful for portfolio composition analysis.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Running Calculation", definition: "Maintaining aggregate values (like sum or variance) as the window moves, rather than recalculating from scratch - the key optimization in sliding window techniques.", week: "7"},
  
  // Performance and Complexity
  { term: "Time Complexity Optimization", definition: "Sliding window reduces complexity from O(n×k) to O(n) by avoiding redundant calculations, crucial for real-time financial data processing.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Contiguous Subarray", definition: "A sequence of adjacent elements in financial time-series data, which sliding window techniques process efficiently for indicators and analysis.", week: "7"},
  
  // Problem Types
  { term: "Portfolio Optimization", definition: "Using variable-size sliding windows to find optimal investment periods or asset allocation strategies that meet specific performance criteria.", week: "7"},
  { term: "Risk Management", definition: "Application of sliding window techniques to calculate rolling risk metrics like volatility, drawdown, and correlation for financial decision-making.", week: "7"},
